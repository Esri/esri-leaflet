# Events

Event types common across components of Esri Leaflet are documented here.

### Loading Event

| Data | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bounds` | [`LatLngBounds`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlngbounds) | The  bounds that are currently being loaded. |

### Load Event

| Data | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bounds` | [`LatLngBounds`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlngbounds) | The bounds that were loaded. |

**NOTE**: The `load` event will not fire if you add the layer to the map before adding the event listener. You must add the listener first and then add the layer to the map as follows.

```js
var layer = new L.esri.FeatureLayer(url, options);

layer.on('load', function(e){
  // do something on load
});

layer.addTo(map);
```

### Authentication Event

| Data | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authenticate` | `Function` | Pass an access token to this method to retry the failed request and update the `token` parameter for the layer. See [working with authenticated services](#working-with-authenticated-services) for more information. |

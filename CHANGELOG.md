### Added
* users can now pass tokens to `basemapLayer` [#800](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/800)

### Changed

* Tests are now run against the minified production code for more safety.

### Fixed

* Features no longer flicker when zooming in/out on `FeatureLayer`

### Added

* Various release process optimizations.
* Support for JSPM in package.json. Now you can `import featureLayer from 'esri-leaflet/src/Layers/FeatureLayer';` for more compact builds but be aware of [caveats](http://blog.izs.me/post/44149270867/why-no-directories-lib-in-node-the-less-snarky)
* Support for browserify in the package.json. Now you can `var featureLayer = require('esri-leaflet/src/Layers/FeatureLayer');` for more compact builds but be aware of [caveats](http://blog.izs.me/post/44149270867/why-no-directories-lib-in-node-the-less-snarky)

## [2.0.0-beta.3]

### Fixed

* Files not included in git tag.

## [2.0.0-beta.2]

### Fixed

* Release process bugs.

## [2.0.0-beta.1]

This release is the first release that supports [Leaflet 1.0.0-beta.1](http://leafletjs.com/2015/07/15/leaflet-1.0-beta1-released.html).

### Added

* New `featureLayer.resetFeatureStyle(id, style)` for reseting the styles on a specific feature to their original style.

### Changed

* By default basemap layers `GrayLabels`, `DarkGrayLabels`, `OceansLabels`, `ImageryLabels`, `ImageryTransportation`, `ShadedReliefLabels`, `TerrainLabels` will now be rendered on top of polygons and polylines if the browser supports [CSS Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events). You can disable this behavior by passing `{pane: "tilePane"}` in the `L.esri.basemapLayer` options.
* Now relies on the [Leaflet 1.0.0-beta.1 release](http://leafletjs.com/2015/07/15/leaflet-1.0-beta1-released.html)
* Rewritten build and test systems to rely on ES 2015 Modules specification
* More build and release automation
* `featureLayer.resetStyle` no longer takes and id and will reset the style of all features. Use the new `featureLayer.resetFeatureStyle(id, style)` method.
* Styling point feature layers using vector markers like `L.circleMarker` should now also use the `style` option to set the styles of the vector markers as opposed to setting it in the `L.circleMarker` options. This enables the `setStyle`, `resetStyle`, `setFeatureStyle` and `resetFeatureStyle` options to work properly.

```js
L.esri.featureLayer({
  url: 'http://...',

  // define how to convert your point into a layer
  pointToLayer: function(latlng, feature){
    return L.circleMarker(latlng);
  },

  // style that vector layer
  style: {
    radius: 10,
    color: 'red'
  }
})
```

### Removed

* All alternate/compact builds have been removed. They will be replaced with a new system for generating custom builds soon.
* `L.esri.Request` has been removed. Please use `L.esri.get`, `L.esri.get.CORS`, `L.esri.get.JSONP`, `L.esri.post` or `L.esri.request` directly.

## [1.0.0]

This represents the stable release of Esri Leaflet compatible with Leaflet 0.7.3. All future 1.0.X releases will be compatible with Leaflet 0.7.3 and contain only bug fixes. New features will only be added in Esri Leaflet 2.0.0 which will require Leaflet 1.0.0.

As this is a major release there are a number of breaking changes.

Also see the [Esri Leaflet 1.0 announcement](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/wiki/Esri-Leaflet-1.0.0-Announcement).

### Breaking Changes

* `L.esri.Services.FeatureLayer` has been renamed to `L.esri.Services.FeatureLayerService`. It should be initialized with `L.esri.Services.featureLayerService(options)`.
* All layers now match services and tasks and now only accept `url` in their options. E.x. `L.esri.featureLayer(url)` should now `L.esri.featureLayer({url: url}})`. This *does not* affect `L.esri.baseMapLayer` which still accepts the `key` as it's first parameter.
* Request callbacks across Esri Leaflet now can handle authentication errors by calling `error.authenticate(newToken)` as opposed to listening to `authenticationrequired` event and calling `e.target.authenticate(newToken)`. **This means that your callbacks may be called multiple times**, once with an authentication failure and once with an authentication success. To avoid any side affects of this you should `return` as early as possible after handling errors. It is recommended you adapt techniques from http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early to handle these cases.

```js
L.esri.Services.service({
  url: 'http://logistics.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/ServiceAreas/GPServer/GenerateServiceAreas',
  token: 'badtoken'
}).metadata(function(error, response){
  if(error && error.authenticate) {
    // handle an authentication error, returning to stop execution of the rest of the function
    error.authenticate('good token');
    return;
  }

  if(error) {
    // handle any other errors, returning to stop execution of the rest of the function
    return;
  }

  // if you get here you are successful!
  console.log(metadata);
});
```

### Changes

* Added support for the `dynamicLayers` option to `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/566
* Restored `bringToBack` and `bringToFront` to `L.esri.FeatureLayer` https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/479
* `load` event on `L.esri.FeatureLayer` now fires at the proper time https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/545
* `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` and `L.esri.ImageMapLayer` will now automatically use POST for large requests. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/574
* `L.esri.ImageMapLayer` now defaults to requesting `json` as opposed to an image to better handle authentication and large requests https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/574. If your Image Service does not support CORS you should set ``{f:'image'}`` in your options.

## [Release Candidate 8]

### Breaking Changes

* CDN moved to JS Delivr http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!leaflet.esri

### Changes

* Non standard scale levels from tile services published in web mercator are now remapped to the standard scale levels https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/548 https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/530
* Fixed a bug introduced in RC 7 where features would sometimes not draw https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/546 https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/536

* Properly handle using `L.CircleMarker` with `L.esri.Layers.FeatureLayer` https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/534
* New `redraw` method on `L.esri.Layers.FeatureLayer` for programmatically redrawing features with their latest symbology. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/550

## [Release Candidate 7]

### Breaking Changes

* DynamicMapLayer will now request `json` by default to better expose the authentication process. If you are using ArcGIS Server 10.0 or have disabled CORS on your server you will need to add `useCors: false` to your options.

## [Release Candidate 2]

### Changes

* Fixed IE 8 and 9 support that was broken in RC 1.
* Fixed sourcemaps by embedding source files inside the maps.
* Fix a bug when aborting JSONP requests
* Other small fixes for plugin support
* Added `contains`, `overlaps` and `intersects` to `L.esri.Tasks.Query`.
* Spatial methods on `L.esri.Tasks.Query` can now accept the following Leaflet types, `L.Marker`, `L.Polygon`, `L.Polyline`, `L.LatLng`, `L.LatLngBounds` and `L.GeoJSON`. It can also accept valid GeoJSON Point, Polyline, Polygon and GeoJSON Feature objects containing Point, Polyline, Polygon.
* Most methods that accept `L.LatLng` and `L.LatLngBounds` now accept the simple [lat,lng] or [[lat,lng], [lat,lng]] forms.

## [Release Candidate 1]

### Changes
* `L.esri.Task` now accepts `proxy` and `useCors` like `L.esri.Service`. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/359
* Esri Leaflet can now be used in Common JS (browserify) and AMD (Dojo, RequireJS) module loaders. Examples will be coming soon.
* Source maps are now built and distributed along with the distribution files to aid in debugging. To learn how to use the source maps [Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) and [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) have excellent resources.
* `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` has been moved to its own repository. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-clustered-feature-layer
* `L.esri.HeatmapFeatureLayer` has been moved to its own repository. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-heatmap-feature-layer
* An edge case when converting ArcGIS > GeoJSON has been resolved https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/340
* `popupOptions` are now properly persevered https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/348
* `setStyle` now permanently overrides the style in `options.style`. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/349
* `setWhere` and `setTimeRange` now take callbacks. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/354
* You can now abort JSONP requests with request.abort() just like with `XMLHttpRequest`. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/354
* `returnGeometry` can now be set on `L.esri.Tasks.Query`. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/358
* a sample.html file was added to help jumpstart debugging local source files.  https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/364

### Breaking Changes

* Task methods that accept callbacks (like `run` or `bounds`) now return an instance of `XMLHttpRequest` as opposed to the task or service.
* `bindPopup` on `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` now identifies only visible features by default rather then all features.
* All API requests inside of layers, tasks and services will now switch between GET and POST automatically when the request size exceeds 2000 characters. This improves IE compatibility but means that for long requests (like complex `where` clauses or long lists of IDs) you may need to setup an instance of https://github.com/Esri/resource-proxy and use the `proxy` option.

### Changes

## [Beta 6]

### Breaking Changes

* `L.esri.Tasks.Identify` has been renamed to `L.esri.Tasks.IdentifyFeatures`. This is to reduce confusion with `L.esri.Tasks.IdentifyImage` and to clearly delineate what these 2 classes do.

### Changes
* Logo position can now be controlled by using the `logoPosition` option on `L.esri.BasemapLayer` https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/210
* Logo can now be hidden entirely and re-added to the map with the `L.esri.Controls.Logo` class. **If you use Esri map tiles you must display the Esri Logo!**
* Fix a regression from Beta 4 where features could not be loaded from ArcGIS Server if they were in non-mercator references. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/283 https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/322
* The `addFeature`, `removeFeature`, `updateFeature` methods will no longer throw errors when callbacks are omitted. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/285
* `deleteFeature` now properly removes the feature from the map so it will now appear after zooming or panning. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/284
* New `createfeature`, `addfeature` and `removefeature` events on `L.esri.FeatureLayer`. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/282
* `L.esri.Tasks.Query` now supports Map Services and Image Services with the new `query.layer(id)` and `query.pixelSize(point)` params respectively
* New `L.esri.Tasks.Find` task for searching feature text in Map Services https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/287. Thanks @rdjurasaj-usgs!
* Support for image services via `L.esri.Layers.ImageMapLayer`. Thanks @rdjurasaj-usgs and @tomwayson
* `L.esri.Tasks.IdentifyImage` for identifying images. Thanks @tomwayson.

### Misc
* [New example](esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/parse-feature-collection.html) for parsing [Feature Collections](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/featureCollection/02r30000003m000000/) from ArcGIS Online.
* [New example]() for labeling points with [Leaflet.label](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.label).
* Travis CI is now running tests https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/271
* Build are no longer saved in the `/dist` folder. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/pull/307
* [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/wiki/Roadmap) has been updated.

## [Beta 5]

### Breaking Changes

* `Oceans` no longer contains map labels, labels have been added as another key `OceansLabels`.
* `L.esri.FeatureLayer` no longer inherits from `L.GeoJSON` and as a result no longer has `getBounds`, `bringToBack` or `bringToFront` or `addData` methods.
* L.esri.Util.geojsonBounds has been removed. If you need to get the bounding box of a GeoJSON object please use [Terraformer](http://terraformer.io) or [`L.GeoJSON`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#geojson).
* Many other utility methods have been removed. If you were using methods in the `L.esri.Util` namespace please check that they exist.
* Layers no longer fire a `metadata` event. They now have a `metadata` method that can be used to get layer metadata. If you need to convert extents into L.LatLngBounds you can use `L.esri.Util.extentToBounds`.
* `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` no longer inherits from `L.ImageOverlay` as a result the `setUrl` method no longer exists.
* You can no longer pass a `cluster` object to `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer`, instead pass any options you want to pass to `L.MarkerClusterGroup` directly to `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer`.
* You can no long pass a string for the `layerDefs` option on `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer`. Layer definitions should now be passed as an object like `{'0':'STATE_NAME='Kansas' and POP2007>25000'}`
* You can no longer pass a string for the `layers` option on `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` you can now only pass an array of layer ids that will be shown like `[0,1,2]`.
* The `createMarker` method on `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` has been renamed to `pointToLayer`.

### Changes

* Added `OceansLabels` to `L.esri.BasemapLayer`.
* `Oceans` has switched to the new Ocean basemap with out labels.
* `L.esri.FeatureLayer` has been refactored into several classes. `L.esri.FeatureGrid` and `L.esri.FeatureManager` now handle loading and querying features from the service.
* `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` and `L.esri.HeatMapFeatureLayer` now inherit from `L.esri.FeatureManager` so they share many new methods and options.
* `L.esri.FeatureLayer`, `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` and `L.esri.HeatMapFeatureLayer` now support time enabled service via `from`, `to`, `timeFields` and `timeFilterMode` options and `setTimeRange(from, to)` and `getTimeRange()` methods.
* `L.esri.FeatureLayer`, `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` and `L.esri.HeatMapFeatureLayer` now support `where` options and have new methods for `setWhere()` and `getWhere()` to perform filtering.
* `L.esri.FeatureLayer` now supports generalizing polygon and polyline features on the service side for performance using the new `simplifyFactor` option.
* Don't throw errors when `L.esri.BasemapLayer` is added to maps without an attribution control. If you do not add attribution you must handle adding attribution your self to the map.
* Remove rbush. Switch to tracking feature ids with the cell key system.
* Remove `L.esri.Util.geojsonBounds` as it was only being used to create bounds and envelopes for rbush.
* add `bindPopup` method to `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer`.
* add `getTimeRange` and `setTimeRange` methods `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer`.
* New `L.esri.Services` namespace to handle generic abstraction of interacting with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS server services.
* new `L.esri.Services.Service` base class that can be used for interacting with any service. All `L.esri.Layers` classes now uses `L.esri.Services.Service` internally for their API requests. This class also abstracts authentication and proxying.
* new `L.esri.Services.FeatureLayer` class for interacting with the Feature Layer API.
* new `L.esri.Services.MapService` class for interacting with the Map Server API.
* new `L.esri.Tasks` namespace for tasks that map to individual API methods.
* new `L.esri.Tasks.Query` class for interacting with the Feature Layer query API.
* new `L.esri.Tasks.Identify` class for interacting with Map Servers that support identify.

## [Beta 4 Patch 1]

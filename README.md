# Esri Leaflet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet)

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugins for working with a handful of the most popular [ArcGIS Service](http://developers.arcgis.com) types. This includes Esri [basemaps](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/switching-basemaps.html) and [feature services](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-feature-layer.html), as well as [tiled](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/tile-layer-2.html) map, [dynamic](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-dynamic-map-layer.html) map and [image](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-image-map-layer.html)  services.  

> Esri Leaflet is maintained with :heart: by folks spanning multiple teams within Esri, but we provide no guarantee of individual features, nor a traditional product lifecycle to support planning.  

The goal of this project is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/) but rather to provide small components for *only some* aspects of the ArcGIS platform for developers who prefer to build mapping applications with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

We are proud to facilitate a project which requires participation from our diverse user community in order to thrive and we welcome contributions from those [just getting their feet wet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/647) in open-source.

Support for [Geocoding](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder) services and [Geoprocessing](https://github.com/jgravois/esri-leaflet-gp) services, as well as service defined [rendering](https://github.com/esri/esri-leaflet-renderers) are available as well (via additional plugins).

### Demos
We've written [loads of demos](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/) showing many of the features of Esri Leaflet.

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just copy/paste into your own `.html` file and run.

      var map = L.map('map').setView([45.528, -122.680], 13);
      L.esri.basemapLayer("Gray").addTo(map);

      var parks = L.esri.featureLayer({
        url: "http://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Portland_Parks/FeatureServer/0",
        style: function () {
          return { color: "#70ca49", weight: 2 };
        }
      }).addTo(map);

      var popupTemplate = "<h3>{NAME}</h3>{ACRES} Acres<br><small>Property ID: {PROPERTYID}<small>";

      parks.bindPopup(function(e){
        return L.Util.template(popupTemplate, e.feature.properties)
      });
    </script>
  </body>

### Development Instructions

1. [Fork and clone Esri Leaflet](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet` folder
3. Install the [`package.json`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/blob/master/package.json#L14-L49) dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` from the command line. This will compile minified source in a brand new `dist` directory, launch a tiny webserver and begin watching the raw source for changes.
5. Run `npm test` to make sure you haven't introduced a new 'feature' accidently.
6. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
7. If you're interested in playing around with our website locally, just make sure you have [GruntCLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed and run `grunt`.  This will start the web server locally at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) and start watching the website source files for changes.

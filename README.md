# Esri Leaflet

Leaflet plugin for [ArcGIS Services](http://developers.arcgis.com). Currently Esri Leaflet supports loading Esri [basemaps](#basemaplayer) and [feature services](#featurelayer), as well as [tiled](#tiledmaplayer) and [dynamic](#dynamicmaplayer) map services.

The goal of Esri Leaflet is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/), but rather to provide small components to allow developers to build mapping applications with Leaflet. It pairs well with [Terraformer](https://github.com/Esri/Terraformer) for converting data and [geoservices-js](https://github.com/Esri/geoservices-js) for making advanced request to [ArcGIS REST services](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/The_ArcGIS_REST_API/02r300000054000000/), for example place finding and reverse geocoding.

**Currently Esri Leaflet is in development and should be thought of as a beta or preview.**

### Demos
There are [loads of demos](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/) showing the features of Esri Leaflet, as well as how it might integrate with [geoservices-js](https://github.com/Esri/geoservices-js) and [Terraformer](https://github.com/esri/Terraformer) libraries. [Check out the demos.](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just change the paths to point to the proper libraries and go.

  opacity: 0.25,
  zIndex:2
}).addTo(map);
```

### ClusteredFeatureLayer

**Extends** `L.Class`

`L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` provides integration for Feature Layers with the [Leaflet.markercluster plugin](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster). Because of the extra Dependency on Leaflet.markercluster we do not include `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` in the default build of Esri Leaflet. It lives in /dist/extras/clustered-feature-layer.js. You will also need to include your own copy of the [Leaflet.markercluster plugin](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster).

#### Constructor

Constructor | Description
--- | ---
`new L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer(url, options)`<br>`L.esri.clusteredFeatureLayer(url, options)` | `url` should be the URL of the feature layer to consume. See [service URLs](#service-urls) for more information on how to find these urls.

#### Options

Option | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`cluster` | `L.MarkerClusterGroup` | `new L.MarkerClusterGroup()`  | The instance of `L.MarkerClusterGroup` that points will be added to.
`createMarker` | `Function` | `null` | A function that will be called with a  GeoJSON representation of the point its latitude and longitude. Should return a `L.Marker` object.
`onEachMarker` | Function | `null` | This function will be called for every marker before it is added to the cluster. It is called with the GeoJSON representation of the point and the marker 
`token` | `String` | `null` | If you pass a token in your options it will included in all requests to the service. See [working with authenticated services](#working-with-authenticated-services) for more information.

#### Events

Event | Data | Description
--- | --- | ---
`loading` | [`Loading`](#loading-event) | Fires when new features start loading.
`load` | [`Load`](#load-event) | Fires when all features in the current bounds of the map have loaded.
`metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata-event) | After creating a new `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` a request for data describing the service will be made and passed to the metadata event.
`authenticationrequired` | [`Authentication`](#authentication-event) | This will be fired when a request to a service fails and requires authentication. See [working with authenticated services](#working-with-authenticated-services) for more information.

#### Example

```js
L.esri.clusteredFeatureLayer("http://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/stops/FeatureServer/0", {
  cluster: new L.MarkerClusterGroup({
    disableClusteringAtZoom: 16,
    polygonOptions: {
      color: "#2d84c8"
    },
    iconCreateFunction: function(cluster) {
      var count = cluster.getChildCount();
      var digits = (count+"").length;
      return new L.DivIcon({
        html: count,
        iconSize: null
      });
    }
  }),
  createMarker: function (geojson, latlng) {
    return L.marker(latlng, {
      icon: icons[geojson.properties.direction.toLowerCase()]
    });
  },
  onEachMarker: function(geojson, marker) {
    marker.bindPopup("<h3>"+geojson.properties.stop_name+"</h3><p>Stop ID: "+geojson.properties.stop_id+"</p><p>"+geojson.properties.stop_desc+"</p>")
  }
}).addTo(map);
```

### Event Objects

#### Metadata Event

The data included in the `metadata` event will vary depending on type of layer you are adding to the map.

* `DynamicMapLayer` and `TiledMapLayer` will return the [JSON Definition of a Map Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Map_Service/02r3000000w2000000/)
* `FeatureLayer` and `ClusteredFeatureLayer` will return the [JSON Definition of a Feature Layer](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Layer/02r3000000w6000000/)

#### Loading Event

Data | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
`bounds` | [`LatLngBounds`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlngbounds) | The bounds that features are currently being loaded.

#### Load Event

Data | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
`bounds` | [`LatLngBounds`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlngbounds) | The bounds that features where loaded.


**NOTE**: The `load` event will not fire if you add the layer to the map before adding the event listener. You must add the listener first and then add the layer to the map as follows.

```js
var layer = new L.esri.FeatureLayer(url, options);

layer.on('load', function(e){
  // do something on load
});

layer.addTo(map);
```

#### Authentication Event

Data | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
`retry` | `Function` | Pass an access token to this method to retry the failed request and update the `token` parameter for the layer. See [working with authenticated services](#working-with-authenticated-services) for more information.

### Options Objects

#### Identify Options

Option | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`layers` | `String` or `Array` | `''` | An array of Layer IDs like `[3,4,5]` to show from the service or a string in the format like `[show | hide | include | exclude]:layerId1,layerId2` like `exclude:3,5`.
`layerDefs` | `String` `Object` | `''` | A string representing a query to run against the service before the identify query is run. This can be a string like `"STATE_NAME='Kansas' and POP2007>25000"` or an object mapping different queries to specific layers `{5:"STATE_NAME='Kansas'", 4:"STATE_NAME='Kansas'}`.
`tolerance` | `Integer` | 5 | The pixel tolerance with which to buffer features for identifying.
`imageDisplay` | `String` | `{{mapWidth}},{{mapHeight}},96` |

### Service URLs

Coming Soon!

### Working With Authenticated Services

Esri Leaflet supports access private services on ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Server services that require authentication.

Handing authentication in Esri Leaflet is flexible and lightweight but makes serveral assumptions.

1. You (the developer) will handler obtaining and persisting access tokens.
2. Esri Leaflet will use your tokens so access services.
3. Esri Leaflet will notify you when it recives an error while using your token and prompt you for a new one.

An example of authenticating with a username/password to an ArcGIS Service instance can be found [here](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/privatemapservice.html).

An example of using Oauth 2 to access a private feature service on ArcGIS Online can be found [here](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/privatefeaturelayer.html).

## Development Instructions

1. [Fork and clone Esri Leaflet](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet` folder
4. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
5. Instal the dependancies with `npm install`
5. The examples in the `/examples` folder should work
6. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Dependencies
* [Leaflet](http://leaflet.com) - the core Leaflet library
* [Leaflet.markercluster](http://leaflet.com) - If you want to use `L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer` you will need the Leaflet markercluster plugin
* [Terraformer](https://github.com/esri/Terraformer) - base library for other dependencies
* [Terraformer ArcGIS](https://github.com/esri/Terraformer) - for converting geometries
* [Terraformer RTree](https://github.com/esri/Terraformer) - client side RTree index for optimizations

These are currently included in `/vendor` as submodules and are built into the `dist/esri-leaflet.js` file.

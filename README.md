[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugins for working with a handful of the most popular [ArcGIS Service](http://developers.arcgis.com) types. This includes Esri [basemaps](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/switching-basemaps.html) and [feature services](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-feature-layer.html), as well as [tiled](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/tile-layer-2.html) map, [dynamic](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-dynamic-map-layer.html) map and [image](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-image-map-layer.html)  services.

> Esri Leaflet is maintained with :heart: by folks spanning multiple teams within Esri, but we provide no guarantee of individual features, nor a traditional product lifecycle to support planning.

The goal of this project is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/) but rather to provide small components for *only some* aspects of the ArcGIS platform for developers who prefer to build mapping applications with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

We are proud to facilitate a project which requires participation from our diverse user community in order to thrive and we welcome contributions from those [just getting their feet wet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/647) in open-source.

Support for [Geocoding](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder) services and [Geoprocessing](https://github.com/jgravois/esri-leaflet-gp) services, as well as service defined [rendering](https://github.com/esri/esri-leaflet-renderers) are available as well (via additional plugins).

> If you'd like to display Esri services in *any* Leaflet application, we ask that you adhere to our [Terms of Use](#terms) and attribution requirements.

## Demos
We've shared lots of sample code showing off many of the features of Esri Leaflet.

http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/

## Example
The easiest way to get started is to load Esri Leaflet via [CDN](https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet). Here is an example you can copy/paste into your own `.html` file.

![App](https://raw.github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/master/example.png)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Load Leaflet from CDN -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.css"

      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <script>
      var map = L.map('map').setView([45.528, -122.680], 13);
      L.esri.basemapLayer("Gray").addTo(map);

      var parks = L.esri.featureLayer({
        url: "https://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Portland_Parks/FeatureServer/0",
        style: function () {
          return { color: "#70ca49", weight: 2 };
        }
      }).addTo(map);

      var popupTemplate = "<h3>{NAME}</h3>{ACRES} Acres<br><small>Property ID: {PROPERTYID}<small>";

      parks.bindPopup(function(e){
        return L.Util.template(popupTemplate, e.feature.properties)
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Going Deeper

### Development Instructions

If you'd like to inspect and modify the source of Esri Leaflet, follow the instructions below to set up a local development environment.

1. [Fork and clone Esri Leaflet](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet` folder
3. Install the [`package.json`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/blob/master/package.json#L14-L49) dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` from the command line. This will compile minified source in a brand new `dist` directory, launch a tiny webserver and begin watching the raw source for changes.
5. Run `npm test` to make sure you haven't introduced a new 'feature' accidentally.
6. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Dependencies

* Esri Leaflet [1.x](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/releases/tag/v1.0.4) (available on [CDN](https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet@1.0.4)) can be used in apps alongside:
  *  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) version 0.7.x.

* Esri Leaflet [2.x](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/releases/tag/v2.0.8) (available on [CDN](https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet@2.0.8)) can be used in apps alongside:
  *  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) version 1.x.

The `master` branch of this repository is *only* compatible with Leaflet 1.x.

### Versioning

For transparency into the release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Esri Leaflet is maintained under Semantic Versioning guidelines and will adhere to these rules whenever possible.

For more information on SemVer, please visit <http://semver.org/>.

### Contributing

Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Terms

If your app is for public, non-revenue generating, non-government, non-commercial use, the free [Essentials Developer Plan](https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/) is sufficient. If you're going to generate revenue or are using the app for government or business purposes, you'll have to purchase a paid [ArcGIS Online Deployment Plan](https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/) when you're ready to deploy your app to production.

If you display an ArcGIS Online service in **any** Leaflet application, we require that you display Esri attribution and recognize data providers. Using this plugin, it couldn't be easier to follow the terms.  Just select your basemap and the appropriate credits will be displayed in Leaflet's own [Attribution control](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-attribution) as users pan/zoom automatically.

```js
L.esri.basemapLayer('Topographic').addTo(map);
```

![attribution](https://raw.github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/master/attribution.png)

If you need more than 1 million [map transactions](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/transaction-limits.htm) per month, please let us know.

* [Esri Attribution Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/attribution/)
* [ArcGIS Online Terms of Use](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/)
* [Licensing & Attribution](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/licensing/index.html)

### Credit

* `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` originally used code from [AGS.Layer.Dynamic.js](https://github.com/sanborn/leaflet-ags/blob/master/src/AGS.Layer.Dynamic.js)
* `L.esri.TiledMapLayer` adapts some code from [arcgis-level-fixer](https://github.com/gisinc/arcgis-level-fixer)

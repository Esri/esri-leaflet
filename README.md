# Esri Leaflet

Leaflet plugin for [ArcGIS Services](http://developers.arcgis.com). Currently Esri Leaflet supports loading Esri [basemaps](#basemaplayer) and [feature services](#featurelayer), as well as [tiled](#tiledmaplayer) and [dynamic](#dynamicmaplayer) map services.

The goal of Esri Leaflet is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/), but rather to provide small components to allow developers to build mapping applications with Leaflet.

**Currently Esri Leaflet is in development and should be thought of as a beta or preview.**

### Demos
There are [loads of demos](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/) showing the features of Esri Leaflet.

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just change the paths to point to the proper libraries and go.

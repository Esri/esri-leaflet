# Esri Leaflet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet)

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugins for [ArcGIS Services](http://developers.arcgis.com). Currently Esri Leaflet supports loading Esri [basemaps](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/switching-basemaps.html) and [feature services](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-feature-layer.html), as well as [tiled](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/tile-layer-2.html) map, [dynamic](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-dynamic-map-layer.html) map and [image](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-image-map-layer.html)  services.

The goal of Esri Leaflet is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/), but rather to provide small components to allow developers to build mapping applications with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

### Demos
We've written [loads of demos](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/) showing many of the features of Esri Leaflet.

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just copy/paste into your own `.html` file and run.

![App](https://raw.github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/master/esri-leaflet.png)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
     <!-- Load Leaflet from CDN-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.css" />
    <script src="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.js"></script>

    <!-- we encourage you to replace 'latest' with a hardcode version number (like '1.0.0') in production applications -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/leaflet.esri/latest/esri-leaflet.js"></script>

    <style>
      html, body,  #map {
        width : 100%;
        height : 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <script>
      var map = L.map('map').setView([45.528, -122.680], 13);

      L.esri.basemapLayer("Gray").addTo(map);

      var parks = L.esri.featureLayer({
      url: "http://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Portland_Parks/FeatureServer/0",
       style: function () {
          return { color: "#70ca49", weight: 2 };
        }
      }).addTo(map);

      var popupTemplate = "<h3>{NAME}</h3>{ACRES} Acres<br><small>Property ID: {PROPERTYID}<small>";

      parks.bindPopup(function(feature){
        return L.Util.template(popupTemplate, feature.properties)
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Development Instructions

In order to compile the API yourself and/or run the tests, make sure you have the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed.

1. [Fork and clone Esri Leaflet](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet` folder
5. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
5. run `grunt` from the command line. This will start the web server locally at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) and start watching the source files and running linting and testing commands.
6. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) if you'd like to contribute

### Dependencies

* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) version 0.7.3 is required.

### Versioning

For transparency into the release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Esri Leaflet is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines and will adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch
* Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**
